## What is NODEJS
Node.js is an open-source and cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It is a popular tool for almost any kind of project!

Node.js runs the V8 JavaScript engine, the core of Google Chrome, outside of the browser. This allows Node.js to be very performant.
## Installation
Node.js can be installed in different ways. This post highlights the most common and convenient ones. Official packages for all the major platforms are available at https://nodejs.org/download/.

One very convenient way to install Node.js is through a package manager. In this case, every operating system has its own. Other package managers for MacOS, Linux, and Windows are listed in https://nodejs.org/download/package-manager/

nvm is a popular way to run Node.js. It allows you to easily switch the Node.js version, and install new versions to try and easily rollback if something breaks. It is also very useful to test your code with old Node.js versions.

See https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm for more information about this option.

In any case, when Node.js is installed you'll have access to the node executable program in the command line.
### Topics, Core concepts and introduction to NODEJS 
 #### Terms and concepts to understand what is NODEJS
  - ECMA script refers to standard language
  - Javascript is what we use in practice and builds on top of ECMA Script
  - ECMA-262 is language specification
  - ECMA Script is language tha implements ECMA-262
     ### Javascript Engine
     Javascript engine is a program that converts javascript code  into machine code that allows a computer to perform specific tasks
   
  - V8, SpiderMonkey, JavascriptCore, Safari, Chakra
         #### Chrome V8 Engine
         V8 is Googleâ€™s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.Its was created in 2008.
     ### Javascript Runtime
     JavaScript runtime is the environment where code is executed. In browsers, it's powered by engines like V8. 
     - Node.js - offers a server-side runtime using V8. 
     - Execution - context manages code scope and execution. 
     - The event loop - handles asynchronous tasks. 
     - Memory management - includes allocation and garbage collection. 
     
     Understanding the runtime is crucial for efficient code, especially in handling asynchronous operations and server-side development.
